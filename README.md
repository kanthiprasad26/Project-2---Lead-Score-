# Project-2---Lead-Score-
Predictive model to score and prioritize marketing leads for X Education using machine learning.
X Education is an online education company that sells professional courses to working individuals.
The company receives a high volume of leads daily through marketing campaigns and referrals,
but its lead conversion rate is only 30%. The sales team struggles to prioritize which leads to contact, resulting in missed opportunities and wasted efforts.
This project aims to develop a predictive model to assign a Lead Score to each potential customer, indicating the likelihood of conversion.
By identifying ‘Hot Leads’, the company hopes to increase its conversion rate to the CEO's target of 80%.
